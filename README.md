## Notable Challenges and Solutions

Challenge 1: Smooth Freehand Drawing
Problem: Creating a smooth drawing experience with the Canvas API.
Solution: Used lineTo method of the Canvas API combined with React state management (isDrawing, brushWidth, brushColor) to track drawing events and ensure responsiveness.
Challenge 2: Handling Background Image Uploads
Problem: Ensuring uploaded images scaled and fit correctly on the canvas.
Solution: Used the Image object and drawImage method to dynamically scale images to fit the canvas dimensions.
Challenge 3: Managing Multiple Tools
Problem: Allowing seamless switching between tools (e.g., freehand, shapes, eraser, text).
Solution: Used a combination of states (shapeMode, textMode, isEraser) and conditional logic to ensure tools behave independently without conflicts.


## Future Improvements
Add undo/redo functionality for better usability.
Allow saving canvas as an image file.
Add more shape tools (e.g., polygons, stars).
Improve text customization (e.g., fonts, alignment).
